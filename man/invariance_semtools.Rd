measurementInvariance(..., std.lv = FALSE, strict = FALSE, quiet = FALSE,
                      fit.measures = "default", baseline.model = NULL,
                      method = "satorra.bentler.2001")
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{The same arguments as for any lavaan model.  See
\code{\link{cfa}} for more information.}

\item{std.lv}{If \code{TRUE}, the fixed-factor method of scale
identification is used. If \code{FALSE}, the first variable for each factor
is used as marker variable.}

\item{strict}{If \code{TRUE}, the sequence requires `strict' invariance.
See details for more information.}

\item{quiet}{If \code{FALSE} (default), a summary is printed out containing
an overview of the different models that are fitted, together with some
model comparison tests. If \code{TRUE}, no summary is printed.}

\item{fit.measures}{Fit measures used to calculate the differences between
nested models.}

\item{baseline.model}{custom baseline model passed to
\code{\link[lavaan]{fitMeasures}}}

\item{method}{The method used to calculate likelihood ratio test. See
\code{\link[lavaan]{lavTestLRT}} for available options}
}
\value{
Invisibly, all model fits in the sequence are returned as a list.

\details{
The original authors of this function are :
Yves Rosseel (Ghent University; \email{Yves.Rosseel@UGent.be})

The function is included in the current package for packwards compatability with an introductory tutorial on
measurement invariance.

If \code{strict = FALSE}, the following four models are tested in order:
\enumerate{
 \item Model 1: configural invariance. The same factor structure
is imposed on all groups.
 \item Model 2: weak invariance. The factor loadings are constrained to
  be equal across groups.
 \item Model 3: strong invariance. The factor loadings and intercepts
  are constrained to be equal across groups.
 \item Model 4: The factor loadings, intercepts and means are constrained
  to be equal across groups.
}

Each time a more restricted model is fitted, a \eqn{\Delta\chi^2} test is
reported, comparing the current model with the previous one, and comparing
the current model to the baseline model (Model 1). In addition, the
difference in CFI is also reported (\eqn{\Delta}CFI).

If \code{strict = TRUE}, the following five models are tested in order:
\enumerate{
 \item Model 1: configural invariance. The same factor structure
   is imposed on all groups.
 \item Model 2: weak invariance. The factor loadings are constrained to be
   equal across groups.
 \item Model 3: strong invariance. The factor loadings and intercepts are
   constrained to be equal across groups.
 \item Model 4: strict invariance. The factor loadings, intercepts and
   residual variances are constrained to be equal across groups.
 \item Model 5: The factor loadings, intercepts, residual variances and means
   are constrained to be equal across groups.
}

Note that if the \eqn{\chi^2} test statistic is scaled (e.g., a Satorra-Bentler
or Yuan-Bentler test statistic), a special version of the \eqn{\Delta\chi^2}
test is used as described in \url{http://www.statmodel.com/chidiff.shtml}
